# kami-app-hygaccess-plant

[![CI](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kami-app-hygaccess-plant/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kami-app-hygaccess-plant/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A product-visualization piece for `cloud-itonami/cloud-itonami-hygiene-access`
(an open-business-blueprint actor commercializing affordable hygiene/
disinfectant actives — sodium hypochlorite, IPMP — for water-scarce /
poor-sanitation-infrastructure markets): **a real finite-volume CFD
simulation of the sodium-hypochlorite dilution/mixing step** for
`int.hygaccess.water-purification-drops`, rather than a hand-waved number.

Built entirely on the workspace's canonical `kami-engine` 3D stack
(ADR-2607102200): domain logic in portable `.cljc`, the CFD kernel is
[`kotoba-lang/nagare`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/nagare), the solve is
dispatched through
[`kotoba-lang/kami-engine-cae-solver`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kami-engine-cae-solver)'s
shared `cae.solver/solve` contract, and the visualization is an EDN render-IR
frame in `kotoba-lang/webgpu`'s `kami.webgpu.ir` shape. No Three.js, no
Babylon.js, no CSS-3D fakery, no bespoke per-app renderer, no new Rust crate.

## Scope

**ONE representative illustrative process, not a general/validated/certified
CFD tool.** Following the convention established by `cloud-itonami-isic-2029`'s
ADR (which scoped a residual "n.e.c." category to one concrete product line
rather than the whole bucket), this repo simulates exactly one thing: a
concentrated NaOCl stock solution being diluted/mixed with water in a small-
batch mixing tank, driven by an agitator/inlet-jet, for the
`int.hygaccess.water-purification-drops` SKU. **Other SKUs' mixing processes
(surface-disinfectant, antibacterial-soap) are structurally analogous — the
same class of problem, liquid-liquid dilution mixing in a stirred/jet-driven
tank — but are not separately simulated in this build.**

Tank dimensions, agitation drive speed, and mixing duration are
**representative / illustrative**, not a certified engineering drawing or a
real production tank's procurement spec (see `tank.cljc` / `process.cljc`
docstrings for exactly what is representative vs. what is cited from a real
source). The CFD mesh is a coarse 2-D vertical cross-section (24x24 cells by
default) with a unit-depth assumption, not a resolved 3-D vessel.

## Where the numbers come from

| Figure | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `:process/target-concentration-pct` | 1.0% w/v | `cloud-itonami/cloud-itonami-hygiene-access` `products.edn` `:hygaccess.product/concentration-pct 1.0` for `int.hygaccess.water-purification-drops` |
| `:process/efficacy-window-pct` | `[0.5 1.5]`% w/v | same repo, `src/hygaccess/registry.cljc` `efficacy-window-pct` `[:sodium-hypochlorite :water-purification-drops]` |
| `:process/stock-feed-concentration-pct` | 12% w/v | **this build's own representative choice** — commercial technical-grade NaOCl solution is commonly supplied around 10-15% w/v; not sourced from a specific supplier spec |
| Tank cross-section, agitation drive speed, mixing duration, turbulent diffusivity | see `process.cljc` | representative small-batch figures, documented as such at each definition |

## The headline number: `:mixing-homogeneity-cov-pct`

The simulation reduces to one clearly-named number: **the coefficient of
variation (std-dev / mean, as a percentage) of the NaOCl concentration field
across every finite-volume cell, after the simulated agitation window** — 0%
would be perfectly uniform (fully mixed), larger is less homogeneous. It is
written into the result map as `:mixing-homogeneity-cov-pct`, alongside a
per-tick `:mixing-homogeneity-cov-pct-history` showing it fall as agitation
proceeds.

This is named to match the field-name convention a QC/batch-record data model
(e.g. the sibling `cloud-itonami-hygiene-access` GMP/QA-data-model work, built
separately and not depended on by this repo) could cite it under — a
**loose EDN-level naming convention only, no code dependency** between the two
repos. This repo does not itself produce a Certificate of Analysis or any
GMP-format record; it produces one clearly-documented simulation result a
human (or that other repo, later) can read and understand.

### What the golden test (`mixing_test.cljc`) actually observed

Running the default scenario (`process/default-tank` + `process/default-process`,
24x24 mesh, 0.5 m/s agitation drive):

- **Flow**: PISO converges in **318 steps**, max cell Courant number **~0.35**
  (well inside a safe range).
- **Scalar transport**: 40 ticks over the 90s simulated mixing window. Homogeneity
  CoV falls from **~332%** (just after the concentrated charge is poured in, a
  small high-concentration blob against a mostly-zero background) to
  **~1.8e-5%** (essentially perfectly mixed) — **strictly decreasing every
  single tick**, no oscillation, no NaN, no divergence.
- **Mass conservation**: the closed-cavity topology (see `mixing.cljc` for why)
  conserves NaOCl mass to ~1e-12 (floating-point noise, not a modeling
  approximation) — the volume-average concentration lands at **1.0000000000019%**,
  matching the target exactly by construction of the charge sizing.
- **Determinism**: running the scenario twice from the same inputs produces
  **byte-identical output** (`= r1 r2` — a pure functional finite-volume solve,
  no randomness, no floating-point-order nondeterminism across runs on the
  same platform).

## Stepwise API — a real closed-loop control surface

`mixing.cljc` also exposes a **stepwise API alongside** (not instead of)
`run-mixing-scenario` above, for callers that need to close a control loop
around the CFD one tick at a time instead of running the whole scenario
monolithically — e.g. `cloud-itonami/cloud-itonami-hygiene-access`'s PID +
ISA-18.2-alarm control loop, which reads a sensor value from each tick's
state, computes an actuator command, and feeds that command into the NEXT
tick's boundary condition.

- **`mixing/init-state`** `{:tank :process :flow-opts :scalar-steps}` — same
  args, same defaults, same `converge-flow` + `initial-concentration-field`
  calls as `run-mixing-scenario`'s own `let` block. Returns the initial state
  (mesh, converged flow, concentration field, `:tick 0`).
- **`mixing/step`** `state control-command -> new-state` — advances ONE
  control tick. `control-command` is `{:agitator-rpm-setpoint <RPM>}`. This
  is **not a cosmetic parameter**: the RPM setpoint is converted to a drive
  velocity via real agitator kinematics (`tank/agitator-rpm->drive-velocity-
  m-s`, `v = pi * D * N/60`) and, whenever it differs from the previous
  tick's, PISO is genuinely re-solved (warm-started, never from rest) to a
  new steady flow field BEFORE that tick's scalar-transport step runs — a
  higher RPM produces a real, recomputed higher face-flux magnitude, which
  shows up as a measurably faster-homogenizing CoV trajectory
  (`mixing_test.cljc`'s `higher-rpm-mixes-faster-than-lower-rpm`, which fails
  loudly if that wiring is ever accidentally severed). A HELD setpoint reuses
  the already-converged flow untouched (this model's quasi-steady-flow
  assumption, made explicit) — which is also what makes a constant-RPM
  stepwise run reproduce `run-mixing-scenario`'s own numbers exactly (see
  `mixing_test.cljc`'s `stepwise-with-constant-rpm-matches-monolithic-scenario`
  — bit-for-bit identical CoV history, not just "close").
- **`mixing/sensor-reading`** `state -> {:mixing-homogeneity-cov-pct
  :temperature-proxy-c :mean-flow-speed-m-s ...}` — a plausible sensor-style
  summary. **`:temperature-proxy-c` is NOT a simulated temperature**: this
  model has no energy equation anywhere (no thermal field, no heat source, no
  thermal BC). It is a flow-speed-derived monotonic stand-in, deliberately
  spelled `-proxy-` rather than `-c`, documented as such right in
  `mixing.cljc`'s docstring, so a downstream reader can't mistake it for a
  real thermal simulation result.

This is a **pure software closed loop, entirely inside this repo's own
digital twin**: there is no physical actuator, no GPIO/serial/Modbus/OPC-UA/
PLC pathway anywhere in this codebase or its dependents, and none is
intended. "Closed-loop" here means the boundary condition of the NEXT CFD
tick is a real function of the PREVIOUS tick's simulated state and a
computed command — not that anything physical is being driven.

## Architecture

See `docs/adr/0001-architecture.md` for the full account (including the
mesh-topology and license decisions). Namespace map:

| Namespace | Contents |
|---|---|
| `kami-app-hygaccess-plant.tank` | Vessel/tank domain model (`:tank/...` keys, mirrors `kami-app-giemon-factory`'s `:factory/...` convention) |
| `kami-app-hygaccess-plant.process` | Batch/process parameters (`:process/...`), `default-tank` / `default-process` |
| `kami-app-hygaccess-plant.mixing` | The actual CFD: mesh + BCs -> nagare PISO flow solve -> transient scalar-transport loop -> homogeneity CoV. Also exposes a stepwise `init-state`/`step`/`sensor-reading` API for closed-loop control callers — see "Stepwise API" above. |
| `kami-app-hygaccess-plant.solve` | Registers `cae.solver/solve :hygaccess-mixing-tank` |
| `kami-app-hygaccess-plant.render` | render-IR construction (mirrors `kami.webgpu.ir`'s documented contract — see its docstring / Render status below for why it doesn't depend on the Var directly) |

```clojure

## Render status (honest accounting — read before assuming this "renders")

**Verified real WebGPU rendering, 2026-07-18** (see
`docs/adr/0001-architecture.md` Decision 4 addendum for the full account).
The earlier "wired but unverified" note below turned out to be a
**workspace-layout gap, not a real bug**: `kotoba-lang/webgpu` genuinely does
not resolve from a lone standalone clone (confirmed, see the error transcript
kept below for the record), but it resolves and **runs correctly** once
checked out as a sibling inside the west-managed `kotoba-lang` workspace
(`orgs/kotoba-lang/*`) alongside its ~20 own `:local/root` deps — exactly the
layout `west update` produces and exactly the pattern
`kotoba-lang/kami-app-amenominaka` already established as a real, CI-green
precedent for a `kami-app-*` repo actually calling `kami.webgpu`.

- **Proven / tested (JVM, portable)**: the render-IR construction itself
  (`kami-app-hygaccess-plant.render`) — `render-ir`, `instance`, `sky`,
  `valid?`, `concentration->color`, and `tank-render-ir` (one instance per
  finite-volume cell, colour-mapped by normalized concentration). These are
  pure `.cljc` functions with JVM tests (`render_test.cljc`) proving the
  output is well-formed (`valid?`) and deterministic — no browser, no WebGPU
  context needed for that proof. Unaffected by anything below — `clojure
  -M:test` still resolves standalone (22 tests / 63 assertions green, no
  sibling checkouts needed) and still does not declare
  `io.github.kotoba-lang/webgpu` in its base `:deps`.
- **Proven / tested (real browser)**: `kami.webgpu/init!` + `draw!` actually
  drawing this repo's real render-IR — not a fixture, the **exact same**
  `cae.solver/solve :hygaccess-mixing-tank` result the JVM tests exercise —
  in a full headless Chromium on macOS (real Metal-backed GPU process, no
  software-rendering fallback). `src/kami_app_hygaccess_plant/render_demo.cljk`
  is the entry point (shadow-cljs `:render-demo` build,
  `public/render-demo.html`); `test/render/verify_render.cljk` (nbb +
  Playwright, harness ported from `kami-app-amenominaka`'s
  `test/render/lib/webgpu_harness.cljk`, itself ported from
  `wasm-webcomponent`'s original `.mjs` harness — ADR-2607078000 Addendum 8 /
  ADR-2607100100 M2) drives it, asserts `#out` reports `"ok ..."` (no JS/
  WebGPU exception) with WebGPU actually available, and captures a
  screenshot. The captured `#out` text
  (`ok cov=0.000018298324379849743 instances=576`) matches this README's
  documented golden-test `:mixing-homogeneity-cov-pct` value
  (`1.8298324379849743E-5`%) bit-for-bit and `576` instances (24×24 mesh) —
  confirming the browser path really did draw the real solve output, not a
  stub. The screenshot itself (`test/render/render-screenshot.png`, not
  committed — regenerate via the commands below) shows the tank's
  finite-volume cross-section as an isometric diamond of colour-mapped
  instanced boxes against the sky background, exactly matching
  `tank-render-ir`'s camera/instance math — real pixels, not a blank canvas.
  Reproduce locally (inside the west-managed `kotoba-lang` workspace only —
  see below):

  ```bash
  npm install && npx playwright install chromium
  npx shadow-cljs compile render-demo
  npx nbb -cp test/render test/render/verify_render.cljk
  # -> {"available":true,"outText":"ok cov=...","ok":true,"screenshotPath":"..."}
  ```

- **Known, confirmed gap — still not a hard dependency of the base build,
  and why**: `kotoba-lang/webgpu` is still NOT in this repo's base `:deps`
  map (only under a new `:cljs` alias — see `deps.edn`). Empirically
  reconfirmed before deciding this (`clojure -Stree` against a standalone
  `deps.edn` referencing `io.github.kotoba-lang/webgpu` by git SHA, run
  again 2026-07-18 to make sure the earlier finding still holds):

  ```
  Error building classpath. Local lib io.github.kotoba-lang/expr not found: ~/.gitlibs/libs/io.github.kotoba-lang/webgpu/expr
  ```

  `kotoba-lang/webgpu`'s own `deps.edn` declares ~20 sibling packages
  (`org-w3-webgpu`, `wgsl`, `expr`, `gpu`, `webgl`, `sky`, `render`,
  `render-shaders`, `scene2d`, `dance`, `physics`, `fsm`, `netsync`,
  `pipelines`, `level`, `host`, `playwright`, `cartpole-math`, `sprite-gpu`,
  `sprite2d`, plus `host`'s own further `kami-engine-sdk`/`physics-2d`) purely
  via `:local/root "../X"` — it only resolves when checked out as a sibling
  inside the west-managed `kotoba-lang` workspace (`orgs/kotoba-lang/*`).
  This is genuinely true and unavoidable for a standalone clone — but it is
  **not** a reason to leave the render path unverified, since `west` exists
  precisely to produce that sibling layout. The fix here is a `:cljs` alias
  (`deps.edn`) that adds `io.github.kotoba-lang/webgpu {:local/root
  "../webgpu"}` (plus `:override-deps` for one narrow real conflict found
  along the way — see the ADR addendum) **only** under that alias, so
  `clojure -M:test`/`-M:lint` (the base `:deps`) are completely unaffected
  and still resolve standalone, while `clojure -M:cljs ...` / `shadow-cljs`
  (which reads deps via `shadow-cljs.edn`'s `:deps {:aliases [:cljs]}`) pulls
  in the real `kami.webgpu` — already gated on running inside the
  `kotoba-lang` sibling checkout, the only place any of this resolves at all.
  The actual wiring (`render_demo.cljs`):

  ```clojure
  (require '[cae.solver :as solver] '[kami-app-hygaccess-plant.solve]
           '[kami-app-hygaccess-plant.render :as render] '[kami.webgpu :as webgpu])
  (let [result (solver/solve {:solver {:kind :hygaccess-mixing-tank}})
        ir (render/tank-render-ir result)]
    (-> (webgpu/init! canvas)
        (.then (fn [ctx] (webgpu/draw! ctx ir)))))
  ```

  See `docs/adr/0001-architecture.md` Decision 4 (original) and its
  2026-07-18 addendum for the full account, including the one real
  dependency-resolution conflict found and fixed (`io.github.kotoba-lang/
  physics` declared via two incompatible manifest kinds) and confirmation
  that no change was needed to `kotoba-lang/webgpu` itself.
- **Do not** read the presence of `render.cljc` alone as proof of an
  on-screen visualization — read this section, which points at the actual
  browser proof (`test/render/verify_render.cljk` + the CI `webgpu-smoke`
  job, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Develop

```bash
clojure -M:test     # 28 tests / 89 assertions (mixing solve determinism + physical
                     # sanity, stepwise API RPM/determinism/monolithic-cross-check,
                     # process/tank domain model, cae.solver dispatch, render-IR)
clojure -M:lint      # clj-kondo, 0 errors
```

Real-browser WebGPU render verification (only runs inside the west-managed
`kotoba-lang` sibling checkout — `orgs/kotoba-lang/*` — see "Render status"
above):

```bash
npm install && npx playwright install chromium
npx shadow-cljs compile render-demo
npx nbb -cp test/render test/render/verify_render.cljk
```
